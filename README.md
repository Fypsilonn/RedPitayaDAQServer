# RedPitayaDAQServer
This project aims at combining several Red Pitayas into a synchronized data acquisition platform. The work of Koheron [1] has been extended to also synchronize the fast ADCs. With the help of some of Pavel Demin's work [2] a server provides access to the two fast ADCs and the two fast DACs as well as the four slow ADCs and four slow DACs. For usage as a signal generator for sensitive equipment, a watchdog mode and an instant stop trigger are provided.

Please see the wiki for further information on building, usage and specifications.

Since this is a project we use for our own purposes and provide it as a courtesy, we do not accept any liability for damages or injuries due to the usage of this project.
