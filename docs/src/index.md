*Julia package for the reconstruction of magnetic particle imaging (MPI) data*

## Introduction

This project provides functions for the reconstruction of MPI data. The project
is implemented in the programming language Julia and contains algorithms for


## Installation

Start julia and open the package mode by entering `]`. Then enter
```julia
add MPIReco
```
This will install the packages `MPIReco.jl` and all its dependencies. In particular
this will install the core dependencies [MPIFiles](https://github.com/MagneticParticleImaging/MPIFiles.jl.git) and [RegularizedLeastSquares](https://github.com/tknopp/RegularizedLeastSquares.jl.git).
