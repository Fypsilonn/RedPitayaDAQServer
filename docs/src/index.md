# RedPitayaDAQServer

*Advanced DAQ Tools for the RedPitaya (STEMlab 125-14)*

## Introduction

This project contains software to be used with the STEMlab 125-14 device from RedPitaya. It allows for continuous generation and measurement of signals with up to 15.625 MS/s, which is not possible with the standard image of the RedPitaya. In addition, the software allows to synchronize a cluster of multiple RedPitayas. This project contains the following parts:
* Alpine Linux image for the RedPitaya
* FPGA image
* Client library (implemented in C) that can be used on the RedPitaya
* SCPI Server for accessing the functionality over TCP/IP
* SCPI Clients to access the server

The code repositories is contained in this [repository](https://github.com/tknopp/RedPitayaDAQServer).
